## Project Title(IMDB movies Data Cleaning and data analysis using Python-Pandas)
## Description:- This project focuses on performing data cleaning and analysis on IMDb movies dataset using Python and the powerful data manipulation library, Pandas. The dataset contains information about various movies, including their titles, release dates, genres, ratings, and more.
In this project, the aim to accomplish the following:
Data Cleaning: We will explore the dataset, identify missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. We'll apply data cleaning techniques using Pandas to handle these issues effectively, ensuring the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis.

Data Exploration: We'll utilize Pandas to perform insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA). This includes generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and investigating trends or patterns within the dataset. We'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the movies dataset and extract meaningful insights.

Data Analysis: Building upon the EDA, we'll delve deeper into the dataset to answer specific questions. We'll employ various Pandas functionalities such as grouping, filtering, and aggregating data to derive valuable insights and uncover interesting relationships or correlations.
